		"recipe": "Grind the meat well, adding finely chopped onions. Salt and pepper to taste. Add minced lard and one egg to the minced meat. All mix well. Separately prepare a tight dough. Sift the flour, add a glass of water, one egg and salt. Mix thoroughly and let the dough “rest” for 15 minutes. Roll out the dough in a thin layer, make circles using a glass. On each circle, lay the minced meat and pinch, leaving a hole on top. It is so that more juice is released during cooking. Cooking a double boiler. Before you put the poses on a special baking sheet, they need to be greased in oil so that they do not stick. Brew poses 40-60 minutes. Good appetite!"

		"recipe": "Prepare your beef by removing all the tough tissues, and cut into strips about 1cm thick and 5-6 cm long. Clean your mushrooms with a paring knife and slice them thinly. Slice your onion into thin strips. In a bowl, mix together flour, salt and pepper. Add your meat and cover all the pieces evenly with the flour mixture. Remove the excess flour by placing the meat in the sieve and shaking it a little. Prepare the pan with a bit of oil. Keep it on medium-high heat. Place the meat into the pan in a single layer. Make sure the pan is not saturated. Fry the pieces for about 2-3 minutes until allsides have a golden-brown crust. Place the meat onto a plate and repeat this step if you have more slices left. Now without washing the pan, add a little more oil to it and keep at medium-high. Add the sliced mushrooms and fry fast until the golden crust forms. Also put into a plate. In the same pan fry your onions, until soft. Remove to a plate. Keep the pan on the heat and add water to it. Wait for the water to boil and start evaporating. Scrape all the caramelized bits from the bottom of your pan into the water. Once your water has reduced by half add the heavy cream and sour cream. Whisk everything together and add salt and pepper. Cook the liquid for a couple of minutes before adding your meat, mushrooms and onions. Let the beef braise for about 10 minutes before serving it with your garnish."

		"recipe": "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, sour cream, honey, and granulated sugar until well combined. Gradually add the flour and baking powder to the wet ingredients, mixing until a smooth dough forms. You may need to adjust the amount of flour slightly to achieve a workable dough. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a thin sheet, about 1/4 inch thick. Using a knife or pastry cutter, cut the dough into small rectangles or diamond shapes, about 1 inch long. In a deep skillet or saucepan, heat vegetable oil over medium heat until it reaches 350°F (175°C). Carefully add the dough pieces to the hot oil in batches, frying until they are golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per batch. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fried dough pieces to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil. Once all the dough pieces are fried, arrange them on a serving platter and drizzle with additional honey, if desired. Optional: Dust the chak-chak with powdered sugar for an extra touch of sweetness. Serve the chak-chak warm or at room temperature and enjoy this delicious treat with a cup of tea or coffee! Enjoy your homemade chak-chak!"

Mix the soaked loaf with filet slices and double-scroll through a meat grinder (you can cook the minced meat in a blender). Add salt and spices to the prepared minced meat and knead until smooth. Pickled mushrooms finely chopped. Peel the onions, cut into small cubes and fry in vegetable oil until tender. Hard-boiled eggs, peeled and finely chopped. Dill and parsley finely chopped. Preparing the filling: in a bowl, mix the mushrooms, eggs, fried onions and herbs. Salt and pepper to taste. We form balls of 5-6 cm in diameter from minced fish. Then we give everyone the shape of the cakes and put them on a cotton napkin. On each cake we put the filling and use a napkin to bend it in half. The edges of the cakes are tightly connected and give the semi-finished product the shape of a crescent (if this was not possible, we make them simply oval). Then roll the whole in the flour, and then in the breadcrumbs. In a deep frying pan, heat the vegetable oil, carefully spread the body oil and fry on both sides until a bright yellow crust appears. We shift into a baking dish. Pre-ignite the oven and preheat to 200-220 degrees. Put the form in the oven, bring the dish to readiness for 15-20 minutes."
